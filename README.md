# Twitch Chat-Keeper

## Description
Allows for mobile Twitch viewers to view previous stream messages and keep up with chat, especially if something funny or noteworthy was said in chat.

I usually cast Twitch from my phone to my TV so I can have something playing in the background. But sometimes, I missed something said in chat and can't view view it since it doesn't save previous live messages. I coded this to ultimately prevent fomo.

All I have to do is start the backend and it saves all messages that comes through chat. Then whenever something happens, launch the frontend app and now you can get caught up to speed with everything! Current, real-time messages are shown too.
